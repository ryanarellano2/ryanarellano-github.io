<h1>A little history on the NBA and Star Basketball and co</h1>
<p>The Star basketball sets from 1983 to 1986 produced some of the most important rookie cards ever produced. Sets that included multiple HOFers including Michael Jordan and the iconic first base set issue card #101 for MJ. Much debate has been had over almost four decades if this set contained a true rookie card example of MJ and several other legendary HOFers. The reason for denate is due to the way these sets were distributed. They were released in complete team sets as opposed to the traditional method of sealed packs containing random players.  The answer is that the Star Basketball co. owned the only rights to the NBA at this period of time. Despite the unorthodox distribution methods</p>
<p>These Star sets were released in a time when the NBA was at an all time low in popularity. In fact nearly bankrupt. If it wasn't for the perfect storm of the college ranks producing Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan, the league may not exist and or certainly woudln't be in the lucrative state they currently sit in.</p>
